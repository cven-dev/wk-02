# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains Week 2 course material for CVEN 5999: Special Topics - Data Analytics for Development, focusing on setup and the data science lifecycle using R and Quarto.

## Week 2 Content

- **Setup**: RStudio configuration, Git setup, and GitHub integration
- **Data Science Lifecycle**: Introduction to data import, tidying, transformation, and visualization
- **R Packages**: Introduction to `usethis` for Git configuration

## File Structure

- `live-02a-setup.qmd`: RStudio and Git setup instructions
- `live-02b-data-science-lifecycle.qmd`: Data science lifecycle concepts
- `hw-02-data-science-lifecycle.qmd`: Homework assignment
- `learning-02.qmd`: Learning reflection
- `data/`: Contains Abidjan waste characterization and country-level datasets
- `img/`: Images for documentation

## Working with Files

- All materials are Quarto documents (`.qmd`) with YAML frontmatter
- Code chunks use R with common packages like `usethis` for Git configuration
- Execute code with Ctrl/Cmd + Enter or click the green play button in chunks

## Git Workflow

Students follow this specific workflow:
1. Stage changes in RStudio Git pane
2. Write meaningful commit messages
3. Commit and push to GitHub
4. Verify changes on remote repository

## Key Learning Objectives

- RStudio and Git setup
- Understanding the data science lifecycle
- Basic R and Quarto workflow
- GitHub integration and version control
